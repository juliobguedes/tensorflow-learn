# Tensorflow Learn

This repository is intended to learn the basics of Tensorflow low-level API. In here, I will not be using canned models, but creating my own models and losses using Tensorflow. The contents of this repository is inspired in the [Tensorflow Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_uuqfgdZZw) by Professor Ashish Tendulkar.
